# Overview

 Just a basic Deno app, using the the boliderplate from  https://github.com/lampewebdev/deno-boilerplate

 

## basic usage
 The bolierplate uses `make` library but it doesnt comes in with the boilerplae so you have to manually install it to your OS.
 In my case I'm using windows, so you have to use choco to install 
 `$ choco install make`
 
  
- `make run`:      executes the `index.ts`
- `make test`:     runs the tests
- `make format`:   formats all your files
- `make debug`:    runs the debugger starting in the `index.ts`
- `make bundle`:   bundles your project into a single file in `build/index`

## Simple logger pre-configured

## ToDo

- I will add more once Deno become more popular
